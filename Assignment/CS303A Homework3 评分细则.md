Q1. (33')
+18' computations of remainders for A1, A2, A3 (6' each)

+15' computations of remainders for A1, A3

---

-24' if no computation at all

-15' if missing important computations

-7' if no computation for the second split

-6' if wrong remainder values

Q2. (33')
(a)

+16' mapping from [x1, x2] to [x1, x1x2] (4' x 4 examples)

+4' margin separator x1x2 = 0

+4' margin = 1 (or margin = 2)

 

(b)

+9' the separator corresponds to x1 = 0 and x2 = 0

---

-8' if wrong XOR values

-4' didn't show example labels

Q3. (34')
(a)

+4' computation of the hidden layer

+4' computation of the output layer

+4' the final formula of the output layer

+4' show the equivalent weights of the no-hidden-layer network

 

(b)

+6' use mathematical induction to show an n-layer network equals to an (n-1)-layer network

 

(c)

+4' 2hn

+4' n2

+4' 2hn << n2

---

(a)

-4' if use d but not b for the bias term

-10' if no explanations of the formulas

 

-14' if copied from the solutions book

---

(bonus)

+6' if you have shown personal thinking about it (max 100')
